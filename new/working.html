        <p>This page was put together with both new and old employees in-mind! Do you see something incorrect or
            missing? Let us <a

        <h4>NASA URLs</h4>
        <p>Many of NASA's internal websites are inaccessible unless you are on-campus or VPN'd into the network. If you
            run into a link that is taking you to a 404 or dead page, that may be the issue. If you are on the network
            and still run into problems then you may have found a dead link. We would appreciate it if you reported
            those using this <a
                    href="https://forms.gle/wtFSRh8x1DfWLNcB8">form</a>!
        </p>

        <h4>Goddard Internal Website</h4>
        <p>Goddard has its own internal website (must be on the NASA network to access). A lot of up-to-date,
            center-specific information can be found on it: <a href="https://internal.gsfc.nasa.gov">internal.gsfc.nasa.gov</a>.

                <p style="margin-top: 4px">Everyone's situation is different but starting a new position can be
                    challenging in a lot of ways. Especially for those moving to the area from a different state or
                    country. We are here to help! We recommend staying in touch and directing any questions or concerns
                    to your adviser and/or lab chief as well as the primary contact for your contractor (if applicable).
                    They will be able to provide the best advise for your specific situation. However, if you have any
                    questions or would just like to chat with fellow early career folks then feel free to contact one of
                    the NGAPS+ <a href="about_us.html#officers">officers</a> and we will try to help you directly or get

                <p>Your NASA Bio page will be a one-stop-shop for NASA management (and external collaborators) to learn more
                    about you and your research. Keeping it updated will ensure that everyone learns the most up-to-date information
                    about you. We have put together a short guide on how you can update this page.

                <p>This document also describes how you can make an email signature in Microsoft Outlook. These signatures can
                    link to your NASA bio and any other page you want. This again makes it easier for those you interact with to
                    quickly learn more about you and your work. <i>This guide was last updated in Fall 2021.</i>

                <div class="content">
                    <h4>Foreign National Info</h4>
                    <p>Moving to live and work in a new country is incredibly exciting, but it can also be a confusing time when it comes to understanding the different steps needed to move, settle and function in the new place.
                        It is for this reason that NGAPS+ has created an Informal Guide for Foreign Nationals (FNs) - defined here as non-US citizens - which consists of tips and knowledge gained from other foreign nationals who have already been through the process.
                        Primarily intended for FNs who are either yet to arrive in the US, or those who may have recently arrived, we hope that this info relevant to all foreign nationals!</p>
                    <a href="docs/2022-NGAPS+_FN_Info_v1.pdf">Foreign National Guide</a>

                    <h4>Foreign National Buddy System</h4>
                    <p>While new FNs will hopefully receive lots of useful advice from your advisor/employer and the informal guide mentioned above, we also know from experience that there are often things that your employer 
                        can't help you with, they may forget to tell you, or you may have questions that you simply do not feel comfortable asking them. Our experience is that we typically gained most of our knowledge 
                        informally through our peers and "word of mouth". It is for this reason that we decided to trial a new "buddy" system! We intend to match incoming or "new to the area" FNs with a more established FN 
                        "buddy" who can act as an informal guide to help you with any questions you have about life in the US, life in the DC area, where to find stuff at GSFC, etc. Your "buddy" will have already been through the same 
                        process as you're going through and can hopefully pass on useful tips and advice to help you navigate any of the unique challenges you may face as a FN at GSFC.
                    </p>
                    <p>New to the US and DC area, and looking for a FN “buddy”? Interested in signing up to be a volunteer and be connected with an incoming FN “buddy”? Sign up here using <a href="https://forms.gle/H6CHiNXndAxNg5tVA">this form</a> or by

                    <ul>
                        <li>Building numbers on the Goddard campus are based on when that building's construction
                            started
                            and has nothing to do with location. For example, B12 is right next to B36 (36 is just much
                            newer).
                        </li>
                        <li>Some buildings are attached to one another like the large fabrication buildings: 7, 10, 15,
                            and
                            29.

                    <ul>
                        <li>There are four primary gates to get onto campus:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Main Gate - connects the front side of Goddard to Greenbelt Rd. Not too far from the
                                    I-495
                                    ramp, good if you are headed to/from the South.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>The Main gate is the only gate you can enter if you do not have a visitor
                                            or regular

                                </li>
                                <li>North-West or "Explorer Road" Gate - connects the back side of Goddard to the
                                    Baltimore-Washington Pkwy with pretty easy access to I-495 if you are headed to/from
                                    the North.
                                </li>
                                <li>North-East or "Hubble Road" Gate - connects the back side of Goddard to Soil
                                    Conservation Rd.
                                    This road eventually leads to the Baltimore-Washington Pkwy farther north than the
                                    previous gate.
                                    Ideal if headed to/from Laurel or Columbia Maryland.
                                </li>
                                <li>South or "ICESAT Road" Gate - connects the front side of Goddard to Greenbelt Rd a
                                    few blocks east of the main gate. It is good
                                    if you are headed to/from Bowie, MD. The <a

                <p>The NGAPS+ has put 
                    together three guides to help you better understand compensation, taxes, and benefits that affect early career 
                    scientists as well as tips to plan for your retirement. These resources were put together
                    by volunteers for informational purposes only. They are not official NASA GSFC
                    recommendations, and GSFC is not responsible for the conditions and accuracy of the
                    information provided. None of the volunteers who put these together were tax experts or financial planners.
                    We recommend using them as starting points but then to do your own research and consult experts before
                    making final decisions. Content and links found in these documents were compiled in Summer of 2021.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Cooperative agreements (Co-ops) are formal agreements between lead organizations and NASA. Each
                        agreement usually has one lead organization and then several partner organizations. Each
                        agreement outlines the science topical areas where the agreement is to operate. Transitioning
                        means that a cooperative agreement will hire you as an employee, but your adviser will be
                        required to allocate funds to pay your salary.</p>
                    <p>Some examples of code 600 agreements include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://gestar.usra.edu/">USRA/GESTAR (610)</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://jcet.umbc.edu/">UMBC/JCET (610)</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://essic.umd.edu/joom2/index.php/about-essic">UMCP/ESSIC (610)</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://cresst2.umd.edu/">CRESST-II (660 & 690)</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you feel like transitioning to a cooperative agreement is the next step after your NPP, you
                        should discuss co-op options with your adviser at the end of the 1st year in the NPP program.
                        Your advisor must have funding to apply to the cooperative agreement in order to support the
                        contract.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 4px">During your transition, allow plenty of time to resolve any unforeseen
                        issues. A US citizen can take a couple of months, 60 days or much sooner depending upon the
                        employment process for the cooperative agreement. A foreign national can take 100 business days
                        or more.</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 4px">NASA Postdoctoral Program fellows are not limited to cooperative
                        agreements after the second year. For example, you can stay on as 3rd year NPP fellows or look
                        for employment in the academic community. Talk to your adviser about what might be best for
                        you.</p>

            <h2>NGAPS+ Advocates</h2>
            <p>NGAPS+ <a href="docs/NGAPS+ Code of Conduct.pdf">code of conduct</a> discusses various reporting mechanisms available to early career 
                scientists in the case of a breach of the code of conduct or when other concerns arise. 
                One of these mechanisms are NGAPS+ internal and external advocates.
                These are trusted allies that you can rely on to offer advice on any problems you face and to guide you through the
                process of escalating / officially reporting the concern should you decide to. They are also good mentorship resources if you ever
                have general questions about working at GSFC.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:10px"><b>Internal Advocates</b> are a subset of NGAPS+ members and co-officers who have chosen to become “allies” for those who wish 
                to report an incident.  They serve as unofficial points of conduct and can provide support and guidance.  NGAPS+ Advocates can 
                respond to misconduct through NGAPS+ (e.g., removing an individual from an event) or can support you through the process if you 
                choose to escalate a matter (whether related specifically to NGAPS+ or not) to more official channels.  They can also provide advice 
                and mentorship.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:10px"><b>External Advocates</b> are chosen from non-early career Goddard employees who have demonstrated strong support for early career 
                scientists in the past.  They can provide similar guidance as that given by NGAPS+ Advocates, though in some cases may be bound by 
                additional reporting requirements.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:10px">To find the internal and external advocates for your division, please reach out to NGAPS+ leadership at 
                <a href="mailto:gsfc-ngaps-admin@lists.nasa.gov">gsfc-ngaps-admin@lists.nasa.gov</a> or by filling out this 
                <a href="https://forms.gle/wtFSRh8x1DfWLNcB8">form</a>.</p>
