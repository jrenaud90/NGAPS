                <h4>Foreign National Info</h4>
                <p>Moving to live and work in a new country is incredibly exciting, but it can also be a confusing time when it comes to understanding the different steps needed to move, settle and function in the new place.
                    It is for this reason that NGAPS+ has created an Informal Guide for Foreign Nationals (FNs) - defined here as non-US citizens - which consists of tips and knowledge gained from other foreign nationals who have already been through the process.
                    Primarily intended for FNs who are either yet to arrive in the US, or those who may have recently arrived, we hope that this info relevant to all foreign nationals!</p>
                <a href="docs/2022-NGAPS+_FN_Info_v1.pdf">Foreign National Guide</a>

                <h4>Foreign National Buddy System</h4>
                <p>While new FNs will hopefully receive lots of useful advice from your advisor/employer and the informal guide mentioned above, we also know from experience that there are often things that your employer 
                    can't help you with, they may forget to tell you, or you may have questions that you simply do not feel comfortable asking them. Our experience is that we typically gained most of our knowledge 
                    informally through our peers and "word of mouth". It is for this reason that we decided to trial a new "buddy" system! We intend to match incoming or "new to the area" FNs with a more established FN 
                    "buddy" who can act as an informal guide to help you with any questions you have about life in the US, life in the DC area, where to find stuff at GSFC, etc. Your "buddy" will have already been through the same 
                    process as you're going through and can hopefully pass on useful tips and advice to help you navigate any of the unique challenges you may face as a FN at GSFC.
                </p>

                        using a

                            Express bus routes to major POI within the heart of DC. Generally faster due to fewer stops,
                            but
                            very limited routes. Great alternative if a subway line is broken and you are exploring
