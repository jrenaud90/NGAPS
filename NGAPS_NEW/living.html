    <h4>Local Nomenclature</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>NoVA - Northern Virginia (Fairfax, Arlington, Alexandria).</li>
            <li>DMV - DC and its suburbs in southern Maryland and NoVa.</li>
            <li>Innerloop - Suburbs inside of the 495 beltway, usually excluding downtown DC itself</li>
            <li>95-Corridor - Regions directly east and west of interstate-95, usually excluding the Innerloop</li>
            <li>Quadrants: DC is broken up into 4 quadrants (NW, NE, SE, SW) that all meet at the Capitol Building.
                <ul>
                    <li>Each street, and many landmarks, are designated by the quadrant they are in.</li>
                    <li>E/W Streets increase in letter the further north/south they are from the Capitol.</li>
                    <li>N/S Streets increase in number the further east/west they are from the Capitol.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h4>General Info</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>With some exceptions most public transportation (buses and subways) can be paid for using a SmarTrip Card. The major exceptions are the MARC, VRE and Amtrak trains which all require separate tickets.</li>
            <li>Parking tends to be the most difficult (and expensive) part of getting around DC. It is usually a good idea to take public transport if you are going downtown and then get around locally by using a bikeshare or circulator bus.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Highways</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I-95, North & South</li>
            <li>I-495, Inner & Outer Loops</li>
            <li>I-395, South into Alexandria/Springfield</li>
            <li>I-66, West into VA
                <ul>Toll/HOV road between the beltway and DC, no toll west of 495.</ul>
            </li>
            <li>I-270, North-West into MD</li>
            <li>US-50, West into VA or East into MD towards Annapolis</li>
            <li>Baltimore-Washington Pkwy, North towards Baltimore</li>
        </ul>
    <h4><a href="https://www.wmata.com/service/rail/">Metrorail Subway</a> (<a href="https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/upload/2019-System-Map.pdf">map</a>):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Before using the subway system, it is always a good idea to first check the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/service/status/">WMATA website</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/metrorailinfo">twitter</a>, or use one of the metrorail apps (e.g., <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.funforfones.android.dcmetro&hl=en_US">Android</a>/<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dc-metro-and-bus/id578496721">Apple</a>) to see if there is a delays or an outage (pretty common).</li>
            <li>Silver and Orange lines cut through DC from the East and West. Westside leads to Fairfax and Reston areas of NoVA. East side of the Orange line is the New Carrollton station which is about a 10 minute drive from Goddard.</li>
            <li>Blue and Yellow lines have a southern end in the Alexandria, VA area. The Blue line turns eastward inside of DC ending up at Largo Town Center (about 15 minutes south of Goddard).</li>
            <li>The Red line starts and ends in the north-west suburbs of Maryland making a U-shape through the heart of DC. Notable areas on the line include Rockville, Bethesda, the Zoo, Dupont Circle, Union Station, Takoma Park, and Silver Spring.</li>
            <li>The Green line runs from south-east DC and crosses the Anacostia river into DC running north until it reaches the Greenbelt metro station (10 minutes north-west of Goddard).</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Bus Systems</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Be aware that some bus maps from one system may show other systems' routes as well (e.g., <a href="https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/upload/PG-County-System-Map-2018.pdf">this</a> Metro bus map also shows routes for 'TheBus' system).</i></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.wmata.com/service/bus/">Metro Buses</a> (<a href="https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/upload/DC-System-Map-2018.pdf">dc map</a>, <a href="https://www.wmata.com/schedules/maps/upload/PG-County-System-Map-2018.pdf">GSFC map</a>) - Covers the entire DC, Maryland, and Virginia Region. Mostly focused on transit to and from areas within the district. The rest of the bus systems on this list generally serve to fill in the gaps left by Metro or serve regions too far away to be considered within Metro's purview.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/connector/">Fairfax Connector</a> (<a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/connector/sites/connector/files/assets/documents/pdf/ffx_systemmap_2019_web.pdf">map</a>) - Connects the central and western areas of Fairfax County to Arlington and Alexandria in Virginia. Usually focused around transport to and from the Orange/Silver/Blue metro lines.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DOT-Transit/routesandschedules/rideonroutes.html">RideOn</a> (<a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/DOT-Transit/Resources/Files/Ride%20On%20System%20Map.pdf">map</a>) - Covers most of Montgomery County, MD.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.princegeorgescountymd.gov/1120/Countys-TheBus">TheBus</a> (<a href="https://www.princegeorgescountymd.gov/DocumentCenter/View/25652/TheBus-System-Map">map</a>) - Sparsely covers Prince Georges County, MD. Route "15X" runs from Greenbelt Metro Station (Green & Yellow Lines) to NASA Goddard then to New Carrollton Metro Station (Orange Line).</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.transitrta.com/">RTA</a> (<a href="https://www.transitrta.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sys-Map-Nov-3-2019_2_HOW_Msys_HoCo-PGCo_191016FNL.pdf">map</a>) - Has routes that connect Greenbelt to Laurel and Columbia in Maryland</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.arlingtontransit.com/">ART</a> (<a href="https://www.arlingtontransit.com/art/assets/File/ART_Transit_Map_Apr2019.pdf">map</a>) - Serves Arlington, VA and connects it to other nearby areas in Alexandria, Fairfax, and Pentagon/Crystal City.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.dccirculator.com/">DC Circulator</a> (<a href="https://www.dccirculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CirculatorBrochure.pdf">map</a>) - Express bus routes to major POI within the heart of DC. Generally faster due to fewer stops, but very limited routes. Great alternative if a subway line is broken and you are exploring downtown.</li>
            <li><a href="https://dcstreetcar.com/riding/transit-tracker/">DC Streetcar</a> - Experimental streetcar program that has a single, super-limited route between Union Station and Kingman Island (near RFK Stadium). Not very useful, but during this experimental phase it is free to use!</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Trains</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.vre.org/">VRE - Virginia Railway Express</a> (<a href="https://www.vre.org/vre/assets/Image/vre_system_map(1).gif">map</a>). Transport from middle of VA (South or Fredericksburg line and West or Manassas line) towards DC and back. Does not run on weekends or national holidays.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.flydulles.com/iad/dulles-international-airport">Dulles International</a> - 70 minute drive west of Goddard in VA.
                <ul>
                    <li>Plenty of parking Silver line metro can get you close enough to take a bus or cab.</li>

                    <li>Fairfax Connector routes 981 and 983 also go between Wiehle metro station and the airport at a cheaper rate (and you can use SmarTrip), but it is a slower ride.</li>
                    <li>Metro bus route 5A runs between the airport and L'Enfant Plaza Metro Station (with only a few stops in between) for $7.50 using SmarTrip.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://www.flyreagan.com/dca/reagan-national-airport">Reagan National Airport</a> - 40 minute drive south west of Goddard on the Potomac River.
                <ul>
                    <li>Limited and expensive parking but easy access via the Blue and Yellow metro lines and many bus lines.</li>
                    <li>Parking Rates: Terminal A and B/C Garage $6/hr ($25/day max), Economy Lot (usually very full) $17/day.</li>
                    <li>From the Blue/Yellow line metro station it is easy to walk to Terminals B or C. Going too and from Terminal A to the station can be a bit tricky, so it is recommended that you use the free airport shuttle bus and get off at the Terminal B/C stop and then walk to the station.</li>
                    <li>Many other bus and train services (including VRE) can drop-off/pick-up at Crystal City or Pentagon which is a short metro hop away from the airport.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
