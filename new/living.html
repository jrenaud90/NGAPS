            <ul>
                <li>With some exceptions, most public transportation (buses and subways) can be paid for using a <a
                        href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/smartrip/">SmarTrip Card</a>. The major exceptions are the <a

                    which all require separate tickets.
                </li>
                <li>Parking tends to be the most difficult (and expensive) part of getting around downtown DC. It is usually a
                    good idea to take public transport if you are going downtown and then get around locally by using a
                    bikeshare or <a href="https://www.dccirculator.com/">circulator bus</a>.

                        minute drive south west of Goddard on the Potomac River.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Limited and expensive parking but easy access via the Blue and Yellow metro lines and many
                                bus lines.
                            </li>
                            <li>Parking Rates: Terminal A and B/C Garage $6/hr ($25/day max), Economy Lot (usually very
                                full) $17/day.
                            </li>
                            <li>From the Blue/Yellow line metro station it is easy to walk to Terminals B or C. Going too
                                and from Terminal A to the station can be a bit tricky, so it is recommended that you use
                                the free airport shuttle bus and get off at the Terminal B/C stop and then walk to the
                                station.
                            </li>
                            <li>Many other bus and train services (including VRE) can drop-off/pick-up at Crystal City or
                                Pentagon which is a short metro hop away from the airport.
                            </li>

            <h4>Neighborhoods</h4>
            <p>Ordered by estimated travel times to Goddard (by car). All times were estimated by Google maps with an estimated arrival time to GSFC at 9am
                during the week.</p>
            <p>The living costs in neighborhoods can vary dramatically. Generally speaking, the further away from downtown and metro stops, the cheaper rent will be. If you are a graduate student or a post-doc it may be better to find a roommate(s) at least for your first year. If you are looking for a roommate, feel free to post an ad on the NGAPS listserv or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/65590660399/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
