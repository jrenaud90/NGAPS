<h2>NGAPS - Events</h2>
<p><i>Do you think your event would be of interest to the NGAPS community? Tell us about it by emailing TBD.</i></p>

<h3>Regular Events</h3>
<h4>Brown Bag Lunches</h4>
<p>Every Thursday we host an informal lunch at rotating venues across campus. We try to always have an NGAPS staff present at these lunches to act as a point of contact. You can find a particular week's point of contact in the event description on the calendar below. We strongly encourage NGAPS members to meet up for lunch even when an officer is not available to host.</p>

    <li>1st Thursday of the Month: Building XX - Meet at XX.</li>
    <li>2nd Thursday of the Month: Building XX - Meet at XX.</li>
    <li>3rd Thursday of the Month: Building XX - Meet at XX.</li>
